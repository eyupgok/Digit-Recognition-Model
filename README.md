# Digit-Recognition-Model
Digit Recognition Model is an artificial intelligence model designed to accurately identify and classify handwritten digits.
Using advanced machine learning algorithms, this model analyzes input images of digits and predicts the correct numerical value. 
It is typically trained on large datasets, such as the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of handwritten numbers. 
The model can be integrated into various applications, including automatic data entry, optical character recognition (OCR) systems, and digital form processing.
